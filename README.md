Example implementation of having Google-Docs like comments in https://lexical.dev . Main ingredient that makes this possible is [CommentNode](https://github.com/sereneinserenade/lexical-comments/blob/main/src/lexical-nodes/comment.ts#L41) which is Highly inspired by the [LinkNode](https://github.com/facebook/lexical/blob/main/packages/lexical-link/src/index.js) from Lexical.

If you üëç / ‚ù§Ô∏è what I'm doing, **consider üåüing the repo**, I and the Open Source Community appreciate it ‚ù§Ô∏è.

## How to use

The real implementation of CommentNode for Lexical is in [comment.ts](src/lexical-nodes/comment.ts), you can copy-paste that file in your project. Rest is just a custom implementation of using CommentNode and storing comments in Recoil state on update and updating comments via commands provided in [comment.ts](src/lexical-nodes/comment.ts). 

If you have any questions/suggestions about the implementation, [open an issue](https://github.com/sereneinserenade/lexical-comments/issues) or [create a Pull Request](https://github.com/sereneinserenade/lexical-comments/pulls).
